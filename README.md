Playing around to learn how to develop operating systems.

My goal here is to learn how to develop an operating system from absolutely nothing in hand. This means I will (at least try) not to use any ready-made component in my operating system. Except, nasm, dd, sh, <any other "basic" linux shell command> will be used. I can't instruct the cpu directly to write my files into a disk image. :D Ready-made components conclude file systems like FAT, ext4; bootloaders like grub, or compilers that compile code for x86 systems (I'll be writing my own compiler to compile (most probably) my own programming language :D).

# To operating systems masters...
Teach me EVERYTHING! How should I manage memory? What should I include in a file system? How could I generate machine instructions from my own programming language? Please pass me your vast knowledge. I will appreciate any help.
